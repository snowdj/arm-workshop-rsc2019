Youâ€™ll get the most from this workshop if you enjoy learning how R Markdown works under the hood (which will involve reading some source code), and are seriously interested in hacking (playing) with:

* [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/html.html), 
* [JavaScript](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/javascript.html), 
* [CSS](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/css.html), 
* [LaTeX](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), and 
* [command-line tools](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/command-line-basics.html). 

We will give minimal tutorials on these languages and tools in the workshop, but it will be easier for you to keep up if you know them beforehand.

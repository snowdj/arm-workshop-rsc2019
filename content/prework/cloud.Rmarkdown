## Work in the :cloud:

For this option, you will:

- **Build** your R Markdown documents via a pre-configured, web-based RStudio IDE instance provided by [RStudio Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/)
- **Publish** your work via [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)

This option uses RStudio's Professional software. These are paid products designed for use within the Enterprise. Access to both [RStudio Server Pro (RSP)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/) and [RStudio Connect (RSC)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) are included in your workshop registration. Your access will be for the day prior to and the two full days of the workshop.

## Why would I need this option?

You may not have time to do all the [local setup](../local), or you may not wish to modify your local install to upgrade right now.

## What do I need to do before the workshop?

Not much! We will provide servers with all the software (R, RStudio IDE) and R packages you will need pre-installed and configured. You will need to:

- bring a laptop with the ability to access the internet,
- bring your laptop charger, and
- check your email ahead of the workshop, which will provide login information for our RSP workshop account.

## Will I be able to publish my work?

Yes! You will be able to publish to [RStudio Connect (RSC)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) from your RSP instance. This means you will have a shareable link to your work online. However, the link that you publish to will no longer be active after the workshop has ended.

## Will I be able to save my work?

Absolutely- there is a "two-click" method for exporting your work within an RSP R project to your desktop in a single zip file. We'll show you how. Don't worry- if you choose this option, you'll be able to grab a local copy before your RSP/RSC :cloud: access disappears.

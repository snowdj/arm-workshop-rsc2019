This two-day hands-on workshop is primarily based on the book [*R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). However, there are several other additional free and open source resources available for some of the individual packages we will cover.

## bookdown: Authoring Books with R Markdown

The **bookdown** package is built on top of R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax (you can learn the basics in five minutes), as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats, including PDF, HTML, Word, and others. It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and using the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) style to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. The book itself is an example of how you can produce a professional-quality book from a series of R Markdown documents. You can find more examples at https://bookdown.org.

## blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown

The **blogdown** package allows you to use dynamic R Markdown documents to build static websites featuring R code (or other programming languages) with automatically rendered output such as graphics, tables, analysis results, and HTML widgets. The **blogdown** package is also suitable for technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX math. This makes **blogdown** an ideal platform for any website designed to communicate information about data science, data analysis, data visualization, or R programming. Note that **blogdown** is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can also be used to create general-purpose websites. By default, **blogdown** uses Hugo, a popular open-source static website generator, which provides a fast and flexible way to build your site content to be shared online.
